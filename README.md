## Hi there 👋

I develop Android apps with a passion for **UI/UX** and a genuine thirst for **knowledge** 📚

I'm a **self-taught**, fully **remote** worker, and it's been going great so far 🙌 I like experimenting with stuff, related or not-related to programming and I'm involved in the **Android community** as an organizer ([Paris Android User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Android-Paris/members/234035421/profile), [Android Makers](https://androidmakers.fr/team/), etc.) 👥

I like to work in teams where **user satisfaction** is a must and where ideas can be exchanged freely, in a **healthy** way 🤗✨ I just believe it's possible to make amazing work without being a jerk 🤷 **#DontBeAJerk**

Well, your turn now 🙂\
Who are you? Give me a shout!
